  { id: 'msg-s4', role: 'user', content: "Oh, I use Claude literally every day now. Last week I was working on a major product spec for our new credit scoring feature. I used it to analyze about 200 pieces of user feedback, draft the initial spec, and even help me think through edge cases. What used to take me 3-4 days took maybe 8 hours.", timestamp: Date.now() - 5 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 + 180000 },

  { id: 'msg-s6', role: 'user', content: "Hmm, it's different from a colleague. With a colleague there's back and forth, pushback, their own experiences. With Claude it's more like... a really well-read assistant who never gets tired of my questions? It surfaces things I might miss, but I'm still the one making judgment calls.", timestamp: Date.now() - 5 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 + 300000 },

  { id: 'msg-s9', role: 'ai', content: "'Got promoted without changing jobs' - I love that framing. But I'm also curious if there's a flip side. Anything you've lost or that feels different in a way you didn't expect?", timestamp: Date.now() - 5 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 + 480000 },
  { id: 'msg-s10', role: 'user', content: "That's a good question. Sometimes I worry I'm losing some muscle. Like, my writing used to be really sharp because I did so much of it.

  { id: 'msg-s12', role: 'user', content: "It's mixed! Our engineers use Copilot a lot but are skeptical about other AI. My CEO is a huge AI enthusiast, maybe even more than me.

It creates this weird dynamic where I can turn around work so fast that others can't keep up, and I have to be careful not to make them feel slow.", timestamp: Date.now() - 5 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 + 660000 },

I think PMs who embrace AI will become more like mini-CEOs - we'll have so much more capacity to think strategically, make connections, understand users deeply. The ones who don't... honestly, they'll get left behind. Not because AI replaces them, but because AI-enabled PMs will just outperform.", timestamp: Date.now() - 5 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 + 780000 },

  bottomLine: 'Across three knowledge workers in different fields, AI adoption emerges as fundamentally an identity challenge rather than a skills challenge. All participants successfully use AI tools, but their deeper work involves redefining professional value and navigating social and ethical complexities. The enthusiastic (Sarah), converted skeptic (Marcus), and ethically conflicted (Priya) represent different positions on a shared journey of professional redefinition in the AI age.',
